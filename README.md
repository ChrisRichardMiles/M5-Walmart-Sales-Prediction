# M5-Walmart-Sales-Prediction
This is a case study of my efforts in the M5 competitions, both hosted on kaggle[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy). We will research and implement machine learning methods, as well as statistical methods, in search of the highest performing model, or ensemble of models, with respect to the M5 competition dataset and scoring metric. Although we will be researching methods implemented on various time series datasets, the focus of this case study will be to find a methodology that specifically minimizes the weighted root  mean squared scaled error, as outlined in the comptetion guidlines. 


This repository documents my approach in the Kaggle/M-series hierarchical time series competition, predicting Walmart sales over a 28 day horizon.

# Objective
1. Develop a process that will produce point estimates, as well as confidence intervals for day to day sales of Walmart products, across 12 levels of aggregation.
2. Investigate and implement statistical and machine learning techniques that can be used for aggregated time series, as

# Business problem

Retail businesses have two problems that arrise from an inadequate understanding of demand. 
1. Oversupply: When a store overstocks an item, they incur costs from storing the surplus of product, as well as throwing away perishable food items. 
2. Undersupply: When a store runs out of a product, they miss out on the sales that would have occured if the product was in stock.
